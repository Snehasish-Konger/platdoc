# PlantDoc - Expo App

## Overview

PlantDoc is a mobile application designed to address the critical issue of identifying and solving diseases in plants and crops. Our app empowers farmers and agricultural enthusiasts by providing them with a comprehensive and easy-to-use solution to combat plant diseases, improve crop yields, and promote sustainable agriculture.

## Problem Statement

**Farmers can upload photographs of disease-affected plants/crops, and solutions may be provided by experts/scientists linked to the app.**

The agricultural sector faces significant challenges in identifying and managing diseases that affect plants and crops. Traditionally, farmers have relied on local knowledge and experience, which can be limited in scope. The lack of access to expert advice and resources often leads to reduced crop yields and financial losses for farmers.

## How We Solve the Problem

Plant Health Saver leverages cutting-edge technology and a community-driven approach to tackle the problem of plant diseases in the following ways:

### 1. Disease Identification

- **Machine Learning-Based Diagnosis:** Our app uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze images of diseased plants and accurately identify the specific disease or pest affecting them.

- **Crop-Specific Disease Library:** We maintain an extensive database of diseases and pests specific to various crops. Each entry includes detailed information, images, and symptoms to facilitate quick and accurate identification.

### 2. Expert Guidance

- **Real-Time Chat Support:** Farmers can access real-time chat support with agricultural experts and scientists who provide personalized advice and solutions based on uploaded photos and descriptions.

### 3. Precision Farming
